# deforestation_In_SL

# In this project, we used high-resolution satellite images from the Sentinel-2 satellite to detect deforestation. We merged differenct bands (B04,B08) to extract the NDVI feature for each image and then extracted the NDVI values of the target area over 8 years. We trained a machine learning model to classify a given area as deforested or not. Our approach provided an effective way to monitor deforestation using satellite images
